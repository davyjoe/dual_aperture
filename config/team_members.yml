  name: Manuel Martinello
  nickname: The Blur
  description: Manuel is an expert in Computational Photography and has spent several years in researching and designing technologies for encoding (and successively decoding) the 3D model of a scene in a single photograph. Manuel's role at Dual Aperture could be considered to be more 'in depth' -- literally. He is working on developing new algorithms for calculating the distance of objects using a single camera shot and applications that can utilize 3D information, such as 'Touch-Refocusing' and '3D image generation'. Prior to Dual Aperture, Manuel was a lecturer at the University of York (UK) and received his Ph.D. from Heriot-Watt University (UK) and his MSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Padua (Italy).
