          <h4>David D. Lee</h4>
          <h4 class="company_title">The Mastermind</h4>
          <p>
            David has a long history of taking products from early stage development to finding product-market fit with proven business models. Dual Aperture, in particular, is close to David's heart because the groundbreaking nature of the technology has the potential to change how people will take and think of photographs forever. Prior to founding Dual Aperture, David played an integral role in creating DVI and HDMI standards as founder and CEO of Silicon Image. He received his BS, MS and Ph.D. in EECS from UC Berkeley and currently resides in Palo Alto, CA.

          <h4>Manuel Martinello</h4> 
          <h4 class="company_title">The Blur</h4>
          <p>
            Manuel is an expert in Computational Photography and has spent several years in researching and designing technologies for encoding (and successively decoding) the 3D model of a scene in a single photograph. Manuel's role at Dual Aperture could be considered to be more 'in depth' -- literally. He is working on developing new algorithms for calculating the distance of objects using a single camera shot and applications that can utilize 3D information, such as 'Touch-Refocusing' and '3D image generation'. Prior to Dual Aperture, Manuel was a lecturer at the University of York (UK) and received his Ph.D. from Heriot-Watt University (UK) and his MSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Padua (Italy).

          <h4>Sean Quan</h4> 
          <h4 class="company_title">Macbeth</h4>
          <p>
            It's safe to say that Sean has probably seen the Macbeth color chart more times than almost anybody else has in the western hemisphere. Sean is a leading expert in the field of Imaging Science with over 20 publications and nearly 20 patent grants. Sean brings with him over 15 years of specialized experience in optical science, color science, advanced image processing, and image quality. His research has been instrumental to the development of a multitude of sophisticated image signal processors in the market today. At Dual-Aperture, he is responsible for improving imaging quality and designing the RGB-infrared signal based image pipeline.

          <h4 class="company_title">Conductor</h4>
          <p>
            Seungoh is the lead developer for the gesture tracking algorithms and related applications. He is also the founder and chief programmer of iStormApps and is a Stanford trained theoretical physicist whose research papers have been published in Science, Nature and Physical Review Letters. Seungoh's prized contribution was co-inventing a novel borehole probe technique using non-resonant NMR technology. Lastly, Seungho is an avid collector of all kinds of music, but favors Bach above all others.
